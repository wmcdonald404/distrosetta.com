description: "A Rosetta Stone for Linux distributions"
permalink: /
---

This project is intended to serve as a Rosetta Stone, a translation mechanism to help people map activities from one Linux distribution to another.

For example an individual may know how to install a package, or set of packages on a Red Hat-based distribution using `yum` or `dnf`, but might not be familiar with `apt` or `apt-get`. This should help convery know-how between types of systems.

# Inspiration
This effort is very much inspired by the [Rosetta Stone for Unix](https://bhami.com/rosetta.html)

# Contribution
